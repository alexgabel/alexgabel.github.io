abstract: Understanding symmetries within data is crucial for explainability and enhancing
  model efficiency in artificial intelligence. This work investigates an approach
  to neural symmetry detection, specifically leveraging the mathematical framework
  of Lie theory. Our approach projects data into a low-dimensional latent space, where
  symmetry transformations can be efficiently applied. By leveraging the matrix exponential,
  we accurately capture both affine and non-affine transformations, allowing for improved
  data augmentation and model selection as potential applications. Our method also
  estimates transformation magnitude distributions, providing deeper insights into
  the geometric structure of data. Experiments conducted on augmented MNIST demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach in detecting complex symmetries with multiple
  transformations. This work paves the way for more interpretable and parameter efficient
  AI models by identifying structural priors that align with the inherent symmetries
  in data.
