abstract: Symmetry detection, the task of discovering the underlying symmetries of
  a given dataset, has been gaining popularity in the machine learning community,
  particularly in science and engineering applications. Most previous works focus
  on detecting ‘canonical’ symmetries such as translation, scaling, and rotation,
  and cast the task as a modeling problem involving complex inductive biases and architecture
  design of neural networks. We challenge these assumptions and propose that instead
  of constructing biases, we can learn to detect symmetries from raw data without
  prior knowledge. The approach presented in this paper provides a flexible way to
  scale up the detection procedure to non-canonical symmetries, and has the potential
  to detect both known and unknown symmetries alike. Concretely, we focus on predicting
  the generators of Lie point symmetries of partial differential equations, more specifically,
  evolutionary equations for ease of data generation. Our results demonstrate that
  well-established neural network architectures are capable of recognizing symmetry
  generators, even in unseen dynamical systems. These findings have the potential
  to make non-canonical symmetries more accessible to applications, including model
  selection, sparse identification, and data interpretability.
